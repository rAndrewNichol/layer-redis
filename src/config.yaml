options:
  port:
    type: int
    default: 6379
    description: |
      Accept connections on the specified port.
  password:
    type: string
    default: ""

      Require clients to issue AUTH <PASSWORD> before processing any other
      commands.
  log-level:
    type: string
    default: warning
    description: |
      Specify the Redis server verbosity level. Choices are:
      - debug (a lot of information, useful for development/testing);
      - verbose (many rarely useful info, but not a mess like the debug level);
      - notice (moderately verbose, what you want in production probably);
      - warning (only very important / critical messages are logged).
  timeout:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Close the connection after a client is idle for N seconds (0 to disable).
  tcp-keepalive:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      If non-zero, use SO_KEEPALIVE to send TCP ACKs to clients in absence of
      communication. This is useful to detect dead peers and to take the
      connection alive from the point of view of network quipment in the
      middle. The specified value is in seconds.
  databases:
    type: int
    default: 16
    description: |
      Set the number of databases. The default database is DB 0. You can select
      a different one on a per-connection basis using SELECT <dbid> where dbid
      is a number between 0 and 'databases'-1.
  cluster-enabled:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: |
